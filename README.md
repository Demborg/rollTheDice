# Epic Dice Roller
![](screengrab.png)

game built initially for 2022 [GMTK game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) themed _roll of the dice_.

## Play
The game is most up to date on [my page](https://demborg.se/rollTheDice) but it can also be found on [itch.io](https://demborg.itch.io/epic-dice-roller).

### Note
- Your aim is to roll over the targets on the map with the correct value of your die
- the game can be controlled with _WASD_, arrow keys or by "swiping" the screen (the last one is mostly intended for mobile)
- Oposing sides of a dice add up to 7 knowing this helps a lot

## Build
The game is built using the lovely [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) specifically version 3.4.4 and it should work to just open the project up in that.
